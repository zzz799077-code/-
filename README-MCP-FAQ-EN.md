## ⚙️ Default Settings Explanation (Important!)

The following optimization strategies are adopted by default, mainly to save AI token consumption:

| Default Setting | Description | How to Adjust |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Result Limit** | Default returns 50 news items | Say "return top 10" or "give me 100 items" in conversation |
| **Time Range** | Default queries today's data | Say "query yesterday", "last week" or "Jan 1 to 7" |
| **URL Links** | Default no links (saves ~160 tokens/item) | Say "need links" or "include URLs" |
| **Keyword List** | Default does not use frequency_words.txt to filter news | Only used when calling "trending topics" tool |

**⚠️ Important:** The choice of AI model directly affects the tool call effectiveness. The smarter the AI, the more accurate the calls. When you remove the above restrictions, for example, from querying today to querying a week, first you need to have a week's data locally, and secondly, token consumption may multiply.

**💡 Tip:** This project provides a dedicated date parsing tool that can accurately parse natural language date expressions like "last 7 days", "this week", ensuring all AI models get consistent date ranges. See Q18 below for details.

**Return information:**

- Number of successfully synced files
- List of successfully synced dates
- Skipped dates (already exist locally)
- Failed dates and error information

**Prerequisites:**

---

### Q18: How to parse natural language date expressions? (Recommended to use first)

**You can ask like this:**

- "Parse what days 'this week' is"
- "What date range does 'last 7 days' correspond to"
- "Last month's date range"
- "Help me convert 'last 30 days' to specific dates"

**Why is this tool needed?**

Users often use natural language like "this week", "last 7 days" to express dates, but different AI models calculating dates on their own will produce inconsistent results. This tool uses server-side precise time calculations to ensure all AI models get consistent date ranges.

**Supported date expressions:**

| Type | Chinese Expression | English Expression |
|------|---------|---------|
| Single Day | 今天、昨天 | today, yesterday |
| Week | 本周、上周 | this week, last week |
| Month | 本月、上月 | this month, last month |
| Last N Days | 最近7天、最近30天 | last 7 days, last 30 days |
| Dynamic | 最近N天 (any number) | last N days |

**Usage advantages:**

- ✅ **Consistency**: All AI models get the same date range
- ✅ **Accuracy**: Based on server-side precise time calculation
- ✅ **Standardization**: Returns standard date format
- ✅ **Flexibility**: Supports Chinese/English, dynamic days

---

## 💡 Usage Tips

### 1. How to make AI display all data instead of auto-summarizing?

**Background**: Sometimes AI automatically summarizes data, only showing partial content, even if the tool returned complete 50 items of data.

**If AI still summarizes, you can**:

- **Method 1 - Explicit request**: "Please show all news, don't summarize"
- **Method 2 - Specify quantity**: "Show all 50 news items"
- **Method 3 - Question the behavior**: "Why only showed 15? I want to see all"
- **Method 4 - State upfront**: "Query today's news, fully display all results"

**Note**: AI may still adjust display method based on context.


### 2. How to combine multiple tools?

**Example: In-depth analysis of a topic**

1. Search first: "Search for news about 'artificial intelligence'"
2. Then analyze trends: "Analyze the heat trend of 'artificial intelligence'"
3. Finally sentiment analysis: "Analyze sentiment of 'artificial intelligence' news"

**Example: Track an event**

1. View latest: "Query today's news about 'iPhone'"
2. Find history: "Find historical news related to 'iPhone' from last week"
3. Find similar reports: "Find news similar to 'iPhone launch event'"
